# vue-lava-lamp
Lava lamp style vue background aka circles morphing into eachother.
These were created with vue3 and quasar, so you might need to adjust code a bit but should work anywhere where you can insert a canvas after some modifications. :)

canvas_webgl uses webgl
canvas_html uses normal 2d canvas mode, which is cpu heavy
